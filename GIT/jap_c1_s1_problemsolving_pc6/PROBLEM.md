## Practice Statement - Traffic Lights

**Traffic lights of most countries follow a universal color code to control the traffic at road intersections or at pedestrians crossings. Red, yellow and green are the three traffic lights; where red means to stop, yellow means to slow down, and green means to go.
Write a program that takes the traffic signal color as input and displays what it indicates. If the input is a color different from red, yellow, or green then display the message ‘Not a valid signal.’**

	a.Write an algorithm to solve the problem.
	b.Draw its corresponding flowchart using the Raptor tool.
	c.Write its corresponding pseudocode.
	d.Create a Scratch program using the flowchart drawn.
