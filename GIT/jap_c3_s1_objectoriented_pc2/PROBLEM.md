## Practice Statement - Report Generation

**Educational institutions are overburdened with paperwork and manual processes. They also find it difficult to maintain records of the studentsâ€™ results, their attendance, assessments, etc. The management and teachers at the Oak Bridge School have already conducted exams for their high school students and the evaluation of the answer sheets is also complete. The teachers with the help of the technical team have to set up a system that automates the grading system. Teams are formed and each team is assigned a task.**

**Evaluation and Grading Team:**

 This team needs to evaluate the results and grades of the students. In order to do this, the below calculations have to be made on the data entered.
- Calculate the total marks scored by each student.
- Find the class average marks.

**Report Generation Team:**

This team has to find the top scorer in the exam and also the students who have failed and passed the exam - 
- Find the top scorer of the class and display the name of the student.
- Find the students who have cleared the examination.  
- Find the students who have failed in a subject and have to reappear for that exam.

**Survey and Statistics Team:**

The school conducts a statistical survey to determine the pass percentage and performance of the students. This team builds the necessary statistics for the same.
- It generates grades obtained by each student
- Displays the roll numbers of the students on the class board in ascending order of the total marks scored in the exam.
