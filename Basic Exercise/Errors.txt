Errors in C++:
Abnormal working of an operation.
1. Syntax Error: Violating the rules for writing C++ syntax.
Missing paranthesis, Printing variable without declaring it, Missing semi colon problem
main()
{
int x=10;
int y= 15;
cout<<""<<(x,y)
}
2. runtime error: errors which occur during program execution after successful compilation are called run time errors.
main()
{
int n=9, a=0,c;
c=n/a;
cout<<a;
}
3. Linker error: When we link different object files with main's object. These are generated when your executable of the program cannot be generated.
void Main()
{
int a=10;
cout<<a;
}
4. Semantic error: when your statements written in the program are not meaningful to the compiler.
main()
{
int a,b,c;
a+b=c;// semantic error
}
5. Logical error: When desired output is not obtained when certain input values are given. Errors which provides incorrect output
but appears to be error free are called logical error.
main()
{
int i=0;
for(i=0;i<3;i++); // logical error
{
cout<<i;
}
}
